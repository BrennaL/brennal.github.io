# Life Beyond Academia

While research and teaching are my main passions, I believe in maintaining a well-rounded life. Here's a glimpse into some of my interests outside of academia:

## Active Adventures
I love staying active through various sports and outdoor activities. Whether it's carving down ski slopes in winter or perfecting my strategy in curling, I find joy in both the physical challenge and the social aspects of these activities.

## Creative Pursuits
Art is my way of seeing the world differently. Through painting, I explore colors, textures, and perspectives that often influence how I approach problems in my academic work. It's a wonderful way to exercise a different part of my brain and find new ways of expressing ideas.

## Cultural Experiences
I'm an avid musical theater enthusiast - there's something magical about how stories come to life through music and performance. From classic Broadway shows to innovative modern productions, I love experiencing these powerful forms of storytelling.

## Culinary Adventures
Food is more than sustenance; it's a window into different cultures and traditions. I enjoy exploring new cuisines and learning about the stories behind various dishes. Whether it's trying a new restaurant or attempting to recreate international dishes at home, I'm always eager to expand my culinary horizons.

These diverse interests not only provide balance in my life but also inform my academic work in unexpected ways. They remind me that some of the best insights come when we step away from our primary focus and engage with the world in different ways.
