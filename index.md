title: Hi, I am Brenna!
---

I am a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of Professors [Khai Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mariakakis/). My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Healthcare AI, with a focus on designing and evaluating user-centered intelligent systems, such as conversational agents, to enhance patient-centered care and optimize clinical workflows. In my dissertation, I explore the use of large language model (LLM) conversational agents for clinical pre-consultations. This involves designing a chatbot-summary system that collects information from patients before their appointments and generates a summary to assist physicians during consultations. My long-term vision is to create a seamless and personalized healthcare experience, where patients and providers are supported at every stage of the consultation process, thereby fostering greater collaboration among diverse healthcare stakeholders. I am passionate about developing solutions that improve existing workflows and interactions, ensuring that technology empowers human connections rather than diminishes them.
