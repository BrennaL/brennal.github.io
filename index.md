title: Hi, I am Brenna!
---

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu) working with Professor [Nigam Shah](https://shahlab.stanford.edu/nigam_shah). 
I completed my PhD at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca) under the supervision of Professors [Khai Truong](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~khai/) and [Alex Mariakakis](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mariakakis/). My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Health Informatics, with a focus on designing and evaluating user-centered intelligent systems, such as conversational agents, to enhance patient-centered care and optimize clinical workflows. My long-term vision is to create a seamless and personalized healthcare experience in which patients and providers are supported at every stage of the consultation process I am passionate about developing solutions that improve existing workflows and interactions, ensuring that technology empowers human connections rather than diminishes them.
